<h2>Traditional Games</h2>

In rural areas, traditional games are still popular among children and even adults. One such game is Congkak, a mancala-style game played with small stones and a wooden board, often involving strategic thinking and teamwork. Another is Sepak Takraw, a sport similar to volleyball but played with a rattan ball using feet, head, knees, and chest instead of hands. Egrang, a game where players balance on bamboo stilts, is also a common sight during cultural festivals.

These games are not just pastimes; they also teach valuable life skills such as cooperation, patience, and problem-solving. They have been passed down through generations, keeping Indonesian traditions alive.

<h2>Modern Games</h2>

In urban centers, modern games like football (soccer), basketball, and badminton are hugely popular. Football, in particular, has a massive following, with local leagues and international matches capturing the hearts of millions. Badminton, however, holds a special place, with Indonesia consistently producing world-class players who compete at the highest levels of the sport.

In recent years, digital games have also surged in popularity. Indonesia has one of the largest gaming communities in Southeast Asia, with millions of active players engaging in mobile and online gaming. The rise of esports has further fueled this trend, with competitive gaming becoming a significant industry, attracting sponsorships, tournaments, and a growing fanbase.
